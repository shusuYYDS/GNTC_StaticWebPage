                <p>After nearly a year at home, my family and my children were already hungry for anything new.</p>

                <p>It’s been tough for all of us – especially the kids. On one hand I feel sorry for them. And on the
                  other hand I want them OUT OF MY HAIR!</p>

                <p>One day, my husband asked us to go for a walk together. So we walked to a nearby beautiful park at
                  night.
                </p>

                <p>I was sitting in my chair on my phone, the kids playing, when a bright, floating light caught my
                  attention out of the corner of my eye.</p>

                <p>
                  <img src="assets/img/3.gif" autoplay loop playsinline disablepictureinpicture style="width: 100%;">

                  </img>
                </p>

                <p><strong>After a closer look, I realized it was a kind of spinning ball that looked as if it was
                    magically floating in the air!</strong></p>
                <p>Several children surrounded. What shocked me was that I had never seen anything like this before, and
                  the scenes he showed were very impressive.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    It was very bright and moving in the air between them, or seemed to be flying.
                  </strong>
                  It's like they're playing catch, they just release the ball from their hands and let it float in the
                  air.
                </p>

                <p>I looked closer and saw that it was the size of a billiard ball and lit up like a flashing LED light.
                  They can "throw" the ball and catch each other.</p>

                <p>Then one of the girls let it go, and as it moved slowly through the air, <strong>it actually spun,
                    changed direction, and came straight back to him!</strong> It's like a round mini roundabout ball!
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>I was shocked! I wanted my kids to see this. So I called them over, and we stood there looking at
                  this glowing floater. Of course, they thought it was as cool as I did, and eventually I asked them
                  what they were playing with and where they buy it.</p>
                <p>Finnally I realized it was called <a class="fr-strong galaxyBallLink"

                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Ball</a> and they invited my kids to play it for a few minutes. I
                  have to say, this thing is so cool in daily life!</p>

                <p>On the way home, my kids asked if I would buy one for them. I didn't tell them explicitly. I knew
                  they would love this spinning, floating ball and would really play with it.</p>

                <p><img src="assets/img/cool2.jpg" caption="false" width="100%"></p>

                <p>After we got home and the kids went to bed, I order three on my computer, just to be fair and avoid
                  fighting between the kids.</p>

                <p>To surprise them, I never told them I had placed the order even though they bothered me every day, I
                  didn't give them hope that I would buy it for them.</p>

                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Balls</a> arrived a few days later, I got it first and played with
                  my husband for several hour.</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                  When the kids arrived home, I sat them were not happy, and as I was thinking how to let them happy, my
                  husband throw one floating into the room behind me.

                </p>

                <p>The kids were shocked and then got excited.</p>

                <p>Not only are they fun for kids, but they give them something fun to do because they can learn all
                  kinds of cool tricks.
                </p>

                <p>In all honesty, my husband and I are also hooked. I spend too much time engaging with it. Every day
                  there would be some words from my house “Mom, throw my spinner to me.”</p>

                <h2>No More “I Don’t Have Interest In ANYTHING!”

                        <p class=cmmnt-desc>My kids have had maybe a dozen of these floating ball/hover toys. Cheap ones
                          from 5 Below. Baby yoda ones. Sky dancers and other dolls that float around. I, personally,
                          like this one the best. All the other ones break so easily. They hit the ground, the blades
                          snap off and crack and that's the end of that. These are encased in a rubbery plastic cage,
                          so, it can smash off of whatever and the blades won't break. Love it. Makes so much sense.
                          They can actually play with this one and grab it without it hurting their fingers - the other
                          toys you can just kind of put your hand under it and watch it hover, trying to not let it hit
                          the ground, or you can just watch it zip around the house smashing into stuff before you have
                          to go retrieve it. At least with this one you can play by yourself boomerang-ing it back to
                          yourself. Or play catch with someone else. It's funny watching them try to catch it - it's
                          harder than you'd think, as it constantly wants to be moving. Trying to catch a ball that is
                          actively pushing away from your hand moving in to catch it.

                          It's a little overpriced but this is the best one of these toys I've seen.
